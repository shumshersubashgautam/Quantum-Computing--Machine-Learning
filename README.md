Expressibility and Entangling Capability (Paper Implementation)
This section contains all the circuit implementations from the paper on "Expressibility and entangling capability of parameterized quantum circuits for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms".

The paper provides an elementary yet useful set of feature maps that one can explore, while trying to build a classification circuit, or rather, any circuit which requires the use of a feature map. These feature maps can be coupled with variational circuits, to find the best match for the task at hand.

Further experimentation and an implementation of a complete Variational Quantum Classifier can be found here.

Below are a few examples of the implemented circuits: on Quantum-entagling & expressibility.ipynb files code.
